# Live Visualizations

This repository contains the visuals that I present in my Master's Thesis presentation at Chapman University with the Economic Science Institute.

The outputs for the visuals are available in the 'presentations_visualizations.ipynb' file which also includes some bonus content that did not make the cut into the LaTeX beamer.

Enjoy.
